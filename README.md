# Web-Scraping-Challenge
Here I created a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

### mission_to_mars.ipynb
In this file I built all the web scrapping code in Beatiful Soup and Splinter (Selenium) to get the data I used in the html page. 
### scrape_mars.py
Once I had the right code, I built an app that is executed by a web page to retrieve data and show it in real time.
### app.py
Is the app that builds the static server in order to reach the info.
### index.html
Is where the page was built.
